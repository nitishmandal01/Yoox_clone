Remember that, even after your purchase, you may contact YOOX at any time using the online contact form or bytelephone, when available, using thenumber indicated in the Customer Care Area. You have the right to cancel the contract entered into with the Vendor, without any penalty and without specifying the reason, within thirty (30) days, starting from the day of receipt of the products purchased on this website. In some specific cases, duly indicated in the Return Policy section in the Legal Area, and only if the service is available, it is possible to exchange the chosen garment for another. To cancel the contract, you may use the Return Form found in the Customer Care area, which should be completed and submitted directly online via the website, or you can send to the Vendor the form available on the Legal Area or any other written notification explicitly indicating your decision to cancel the contract. If you choose to use the Return Form to be submitted online via the website, the Vendor will send an email confirming receipt of your cancellation request. If you choose one of the other options, you shall be responsible for proving that you exercised your right of cancellation correctly and in a timely manner. The Right of Cancellation is considered to be correctly exercised when the following conditions are also fully satisfied: a. The Return Form directly submitted online via the website or any other explicit notification of your decision to cancel the contract must be correctly completed and sent to the Vendor within thirty (30) days, starting from the day of receipt of the products; b. the products should not have been used, worn, washed; c. the identification tag should still be attached to the products with the disposable seal, which forms an integral part of the goods; d. the products should be returned in their original packaging (in the case of audio CDs, books, design objects, designer toys and adult games, the packaging’s original seal must be intact; if you wish to return a kit, you must include all of the items comprising it); e. the products must be entrusted to the courier company within thirty (30) days, starting from the day of receipt of the products; f. the products should not be damaged. The only costs to be borne by you are those for returning the purchased products, except if the Vendor expressly exempted you from such costs at the time of the purchase and on the condition that you use the courier service indicated by the Vendor in the Return Form. Without prejudice to the application of the mandatory consumer protection provisions, all products sold by the Vendor are covered by a twenty-four (24) month guarantee for lack of conformity. You shall inform the Vendor of the existence of any such lack of conformity within a period of two (2) months from the day when you detected the lack of conformity. Please contact our Customer Care. In case of lack of conformity, you may choose between the repair or replacement of the product.
